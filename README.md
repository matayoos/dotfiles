# Dotfiles for Ubuntu

My preferred starting congifurations for Ubuntu Desktop. Current version 20.04 Focal Fossa.

Created with [rwxrob](https://rwx.gg/) and inspired by [victoriadrake](https://github.com/victoriadrake/dotfiles).

## Usage

After installing your fresh OS, do:

```sh
sudo apt install git vim tmux -y
```
