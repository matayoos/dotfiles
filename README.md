# Dotfiles for Ubuntu

My preferred starting configurations for Ubuntu Desktop. Current version 20.04 Focal Fossa.

Created with [rwxrob](https://rwx.gg/) and inspired by [victoriadrake](https://github.com/victoriadrake/dotfiles).

## Usage

After installing your fresh OS, do:

```sh
sudo apt install git -y
```

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matayoos/dotfiles.git
```

And then run the install script:
```sh
./install
```

You're ready to go!
